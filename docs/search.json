    "section": "Downloading from the Internet using Curl",
    "text": "Downloading from the Internet using Curl\nCurl and wget are command line tools that allows you to download files from the Internet. curl and wget are installed by default on most Linux systems. if you do not have either tool installed, you can use the commands below to install curl and wget on Ubuntu.\n   sudo apt install curl\n   sudo apt install wget\nIf you are using a Mac, you can install curl and wget using the following commands:\n    brew install curl\n    brew install wget\n\nHow to Use Curl\nThe curl syntax is :\ncurl [options] [URL...] \nIn its simplest form, curl is used to download a file from the Internet without any options.\n    curl example.com\nThe above example, curl displays the contents of the file to the standard output. The command above will download and print the source code of the example.com homepage in your terminal window.\n\n\nSave the Output to a File\nWe can use the -o option to save the output to a file.\n    curl -o example.html example.com\nOR\n    curl example.com -o example.html\nThe above example will save the output to a file named example.html instead of printing it to the terminal. You can also redirect the output to a file using the > operator.\n    curl -o example.com > example.html\nWe can also use O (uppercase) to save to original file name\n\n   curl -O example.com\nThe above example will save the output to a file named example.com instead of printing it to the terminal.\nSometimes, it’s a good idea to set the verbose mode on. This may provide useful information about the progress of the download.\n\ncurl -v example.com\ncurl outputs a progress meter that shows the download rate and the expected time of completion. You can also use the -s option to hide the progress meter and the progress.\ncurl -s example.com\n\n\nFollowing Redirects\nWhen accessing shortened URL with curl, such as: http://bit.ly/, we need to set the -L option to automatically follow redirects\n    curl -L http://bit.ly/\n\n\nUsing Curl to Download from FTP server\nCurl has over 20 built-in FTP commands. You can use curl to download files from FTP servers as follows:\n    curl -s \"ftp://ftp.gnu.org/welcome.msg\" | trim\n\n\nHow to use Wget Command\nThe wget command is similar to curl, but it does not print the output to the terminal. Instead, it saves the output to a file. Its syntax is shown below:\n    wget [options] [URL...]\nYou can download a file from the Internet using wget and saved to a file.\n    wget -O example.html example.com\n    wget example.com\nYou can also save the output to a file using the -O option.\n    wget -O example.html example.com\nYou can save in a specify folder using the -P option.\n    wget -P /home/example.com example.com"

Wget is command line only. There’s no library.\nCurl is powered by libcurl - a cross-platform library with a stable API that can be used by each and everyone.\nCurl is generally preferred since it supports more features than wget. For comparison here is the list of features of available with different tools:"

    "text": "My mentor, Sebastian Ruder advises PhD students to write blogs and has this to say: “Having a blog is the single thing that has led to the most positive interactions throughout my PhD.”1\nI was inspired, but I’ve been holding off writing blog posts consistently. I started in 2020 and stopped after two blog posts. Recently, I read a blog post by the co-founder of fast.ai, Rachel Thomas, “Why you should write blogpost”2 and watched an RStudio talk by David Robinson, “The unreasonable effectiveness of public work.”3 Both Rachel and David convinced me about the benefits of writing a blog post. Therefore, I braced up to start blogging consistently at least once fortnightly. As a Ph.D. student, writing habits will strongly build my writing and creativity muscles to the max.\nThere are many reasons one writes a blog. For me, below are only five reasons I think a blog will help me along the way of building my career."

    "text": "Deliberate practice\nDeliberate practice is a systematic, focused, consistent, goal-oriented training that builds expertise or improves performance.45 Building expertise in any field is not a marathon; it is a series of Sprints. Evidence has shown that experts or geniuses are always made, not born6 7. For example, bodybuilders, musicians, and footballers consistently practice to achieve mastery. No one becomes an expert from day one. The same is also true for writing and any other skills. Consistent writing, even small content but engaging and informative, will improve your writing skills. As we fondly say, “practice makes perfect.” Consistent practice allows one to do a task while thinking about other things. For example, a professional orator can deliver an excellent speech without reading from any single note. Stopping to think about the task can sometimes result in a flawless performance. People refer to this performance as being “in the zone. Aristotle said:”We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” \nDeliberate practice does not make what we learn easier; it changes the brain (Myelination). This concept is notably expressed as “cells that fire together, wire together.” Sometimes, we reach an “aha!” moment when learning difficult stuff - that is when someone has been struggling to understand a concept, and it suddenly becomes apparent - the clarity does not come out of nowhere.\n\nRather, it results from a steady accumulation of information. That’s because adding additional information opens up memories associated with the task. Once those memory neurons are active, they can form new connections. They also can form stronger connections within an existing network. Over time, your level of understanding increases until you suddenly “get” it 8.\n\nTherefore, this blog will serve as a way for me to do deliberate practices of many skills (writing, machine learning, visualization, python, r and, many more)"

I write code and forget how I did it or google the same thing many times So, anything that I often google or write a complex program, I will write a blog post on it. That way, I will refer to it. Hadley Wickham inspired me in his book R for Data Science; he said, if you write the same code three times, then, you write a function for that code. Hadley’s idea was adapted from code refactoring rule of thumb (Rule of three), which states that “two instances of similar code don’t require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.”9"

    "text": "Learning by teaching (protégé effect)\nRobert Heinlein said, when one teaches, two learn. It means whenever you teach or explain a concept to someone, you will learn something from it or get a better insight and ultimately reach the “aha” moment. Therefore, writing a good tutorial about a brain-bending concept without dumbing it down is a great way to learn and increase visibility. As Einstein says, “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” A study11 found that when students teach the lesson’s content (active learning), they develop a more in-depth and longer-lasting understanding of the material than students who do not teach it( passive learning). Therefore, this blog will allow me to write my research and summary of papers and man more. The approach of learning by teaching was widely known as Feynman learning technique12"
