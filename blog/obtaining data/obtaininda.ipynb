Sometimes, the data comes in a compressed form or in a binary format such as a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet. Tools such as curl, tar, wget, csvtool and others can be used to download data. ---Data Science at command Line \n",

    "**Curl** and **wget** are command line tools that allows you to download files from the Internet. curl and wget are installed by default on most Linux systems. if you do not have either tool installed, you can use the commands below to install curl and wget on Ubuntu.\n",

    "#### How to Use Curl #\n",
    "\n",
    "The curl syntax is : curl [options] [URL...]. In its simplest form, curl is used to download a file from the Internet without any options.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    curl example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example, curl displays the contents of the file to the standard output. The command above will download and print the source code of the example.com homepage in your terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Save the Output to a File \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the -o option to save the output to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    curl -o example.html example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example will save the output to a file named example.html instead of printing it to the terminal. You can also redirect the output to a file using the > operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    curl -o example.com > example.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use O (uppercase) to save to original file name\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "   curl -O example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above example will save the output to a file named example.com instead of printing it to the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, it’s a good idea to set the verbose mode on. This may provide useful information about the progress of the download.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "curl -v example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
